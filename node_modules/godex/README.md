# godex.js
The godex is a javascript library full of Pokemon Go data.   
_Note: `v1.3.3` and below will break when upgraded to `v1.4.5+`_.  
_This is due to all get methods being absorbed into `get`_.

### Methods
_Variables passed in [] are optional._

##### `dex.get([location], thing)`
This is the master fetch function. It will get you anything! You can pass a pokemon id, name, or key to get a pokemon. Alternatively, specify the thing you're looking for to retrieve that as well. You can also use the "all" specifier to retrieve all of whatever it is you're looking for.

```
// Fetch pokemon
dex.get("Bulbasaur");
dex.get(1);
dex.get("1");
dex.get(001);
dex.get("001");

// Fetch other data
dex.get("type", "bug");
dex.get("move", "Twister");

// Fetch nested data!
dex.get("pokemon.type", "bug");

// Note: nested data only works
// if the subproperty exists!!
```

##### `dex.appraise(options)`   
This method returns the IV's of your pokemon!

```
dex.appraise({
  pokemon: 'Aerodactyl',
  cp: 1495,
  hp: 113,
  dust: 3500,
  powered: true,    // powered up?
  strongAtk: false, // Gym Leader says "x" is
  strongDef: true,  // your poke's best stat,
  strongHP: false   // send that as true.
})
```
